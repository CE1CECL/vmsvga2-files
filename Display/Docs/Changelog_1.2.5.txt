Changelog from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5
=============================
1) Added Support for ScreenObject2 (available Workstation 8/Fusion 4 and beyond).
2) Fixed bug with use of ScreenObject/ScreenObject2 under Workstation 9/Fusion 5.
3) Memory Allocation has been overhauled to support unrestricted allocation
   of guest RAM for CGS surfaces.  Previously VMsvga2 was limited to use
   of guest VRAM for this purpose.
   This implies guest VRAM can be reduced to its minimum value of
   16000 KiB - and VMsvga2 will still provide full functionality.
   guest VRAM size may be set in the VMX file as follows
     svga.autodetect = "FALSE"
     svga.vramSize = "16384000"
4) Window grab in Grab application has worked since OS 10.7 due to fixes
   made in OS X.

Changelog from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4
=============================

1) Added display modes 1152x720, 2560x1440.
2) Smoother mode changes when using fit-guest/autofit-guest.
3) Alpha Cursor conversion optimized with MMX.
4) Log levels for vmw_log_fb are 1 - 3.
5) Supports 256-byte EDID.
6) Checks admin privilege for vmware-tools-daemon when doing [auto]fit-guest.
7) Limits [auto]fit-guest resolution to maximum supported by host.
8) Supports Surface-to-Surface copy-blit in Accelerator.
9) Improved screen grab function to eliminate an intermediate copy.
10) Restrict creation of surfaces to WindowServer.
11) Discontinued support for OS X Leopard.

Changelog from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3
=============================

1) Added three more display modes
   - 2048x1152, 1600x900, 1366x768

Changelog from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2
=============================

This is a bugfix release related to several apps from OS 10.6.

1) Fixed crash in "DVD Player".  It still doesn't work, but exits gracefully
   with an error message.

2) Fixed invisible selection frame in the Grab application.

3) Grabbing a window in Grab freezes the system (same result for a hotkey-based window screenshot).
   - This looks like a problem in the WindowServer.  It takes a sequence of steps
     that lead it into a deadlock.
   - I've added ad-hoc code in the driver to prevent the deadlock, but the window-grab feature
     still doesn't work.  I suggest using selection-grabs instead which work both in the
     Grab application and with hotkeys.

4) Optimized some unnecessary memory allocations in the main code sequence followed by the WindowServer.

Changelog from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1
=============================

1) Fixed the guest VRAM size bug
   - This bug happens if the guest vram size is less than 128MB and Screen Object is active.
   - vram size was being reported incorrectly.
   - As a result the vram allocator was failing.

Changelog from 1.1.1 to 1.2.0
=============================

1) Added four more display modes
   - 1920x1080, 1280x960, 1280x768, 1280x720

2) VMsvga2 now supports the Screen Capture (snapshot) feature on OS 10.6.

3) Added support for the new Screen Objects feature of Workstation 7/Fusion 3.
   - The presence of Screen Objects obsoletes the "-svga3d" option.  With Screen Objects, the driver
     will automagically select the best rendering sequence for each function.
   - For a VMX file with guestOS = "darwin..." Screen Objects are on by default.
   - For a VMX file with guestOS = "freebsd...", Screen Objects need to be enabled.  Add
     the following lines to your VMX file
       svga.enableScreenObject = "TRUE"
       svga.enableTracesReg = "TRUE"

4) Enhanced the support of CGSSurfaces for Apple applications that use them
   outside of the OpenGL framework.


Changelog from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
=============================

1) Added three more display modes - 1920x1440, 2048x1536 and 2560x1600.
   - The mode list is trimmed to resolutions supported by the host, so not all modes may appear.

2) Fixed blit bugs affecting window motion in "-svga3d" mode on VMware Workstation 7.

3) The Leopard version of VMsvga2 impersonates VMwareIOFramebuffer, so it's no longer necessary
   to patch VMware darwin Tools from Fusion 2.x to get fit-guest support.
   - This feature is not available in the SnowLeopard version of VMsvga2.  Apple made a
     change to IOKit in OS 10.6, so the impersonation option doesn't work.

4) Fixed the shutdown procedure so it's possible to see changes in the display made
   after the WindowServer shuts down.
