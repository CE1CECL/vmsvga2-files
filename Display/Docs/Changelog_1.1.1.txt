Changelog from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1
=============================

1) Added three more display modes - 1920x1440, 2048x1536 and 2560x1600.
   - The mode list is trimmed to resolutions supported by the host, so not all modes may appear.

2) Fixed blit bugs affecting window motion in "-svga3d" mode on VMware Workstation 7.

3) The Leopard version of VMsvga2 impersonates VMwareIOFramebuffer, so it's no longer necessary
   to patch VMware darwin Tools from Fusion 2.x to get fit-guest support.
   - This feature is not available in the SnowLeopard version of VMsvga2.  Apple made a
     change to IOKit in OS 10.6, so the impersonation option doesn't work.

4) Fixed the shutdown procedure so it's possible to see changes in the display made
   after the WindowServer shuts down.
